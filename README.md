## Who Am I
- Hello World. I'm Enes. 
- I'm 25 years old.
- I live in Turkey.
- I'm curious behind the scenes of blockchain. I am also working. I'm doing testnet in my spare time and trying to set up Node.
- I've joined about 100 testnets so far. I've tested many different platforms and networks. If you want to improve yourself, you can try the node codes in my profile.
